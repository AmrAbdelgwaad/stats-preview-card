# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component solution


![preivre](desktop-preview.jpg)

This is my second project from [fontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62/hub) it takes me so much time than expected and i am pretty sure that i have so much code than it should be and i can't do the photo layering using [mix blend mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode) so any reviews and advices about the projects and the readme file are welcomed, and i will edit this project for sure
